Generate Exam Paper using Modified Artificial Bee Colony

In this application, four contributions are provided to overcome test design challenges for the student assessment. First, a tool is developed to generate a synthetic question pool. Second, an objective function is designed based on the considered attributes. Third, the popular swarm and evolutionary optimization methods, namely particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony, and differential search algorithm are comparatively studied with novel methodologies applied to them. Finally, as the state-of-the-art methods, artificial bee colony, and differential search algorithm are further modified to improve the solution of the test design.
Note: QuestionPool.mat data set is included in the file.
